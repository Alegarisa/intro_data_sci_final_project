## Description of the dataset to be used

We will be using [Pew Research Center's](http://www.pewresearch.org) 
*Core Trends Survey* from January 3-10, 2018. It contains data on `r nrow(df)`
people and nearly `r ncol(df)` variables. The variables primarily concern social
media use, but the dataset also includes participant demographics.
